## Results and Discussion

#### Differential Gene Expression Analysis
- Identified **1,296 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)**:  
  - 664 upregulated genes 
  - 632 downregulated genes
- These changes indicate substantial transcriptional alterations in uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS) tissues compared to normal samples.  
- The large number of DEGs suggests widespread molecular dysregulation contributing to tumor development.

#### Pathway Enrichment and PPI Network Analysis
- DEGs are enriched in key signaling pathways:  
  - **Relaxin signaling pathway** promotes tissue remodeling and fibrosis, which may facilitate tumor invasion. 
  - **Prolactin signaling pathway** influences cell proliferation and survival, contributing to tumor aggressiveness.  
  - **C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway** plays a role in immune response, indicating possible immune evasion or modulation by uLMS cells.

#### Hub Genes and Their Roles
- **RPS27A:** Involved in ribosome assembly, supporting increased protein synthesis needed for rapid cancer cell proliferation.  
- **CCNA2:** A key cell cycle regulator that likely promotes uncontrolled cell division in cancer.  
- **EPRS1:** Implicated in amino acid metabolism and protein synthesis, aiding tumor growth and adaptation.

## Conclusion
- This study provides a comprehensive transcriptomic overview of uterine leiomyosarcoma, offering valuable insights into its molecular landscape.
- The results pave the way for further functional validation and the development of targeted therapies or biomarkers for early diagnosis and improved treatment outcomes in uLMS patients.

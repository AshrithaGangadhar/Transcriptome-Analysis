## Results and Discussion

#### Differential Gene Expression Analysis

| Description                                 | Count  |
|---------------------------------------------|--------|
| Total differentially expressed genes (DEGs) | 1,296  |
| Upregulated genes                           | 664    |
| Downregulated genes                         | 632    |

#### Pathway Enrichment and PPI Network Analysis

| Signaling Pathway                   | Role/Implication                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Relaxin signaling pathway          | Promotes tissue remodeling and fibrosis, which may facilitate tumor invasion.                   |
| Prolactin signaling pathway       | Influences cell proliferation and survival, contributing to tumor aggressiveness.               |
| C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway | Plays a role in immune response, indicating possible immune evasion or modulation by uLMS cells. |

#### Hub Genes and Their Roles

| Rank | Gene Name | Score | Function |
|------|-----------|-------|----------|
| 1    | RPS27A    | 112   |Supports increased protein synthesis needed for rapid cancer cell proliferation|
| 2    | CCNA2     | 58    |A key cell cycle regulator that likely promotes uncontrolled cell division in cancer|
| 3    | EPRS1     | 52    |Implicated in amino acid metabolism and protein synthesis, aiding tumor growth and adaptation|

## Conclusion
- This study provides a comprehensive transcriptomic overview of uterine leiomyosarcoma, offering valuable insights into its molecular landscape.
- The results pave the way for further functional validation and the development of targeted therapies or biomarkers for early diagnosis and improved treatment outcomes in uLMS patients.
